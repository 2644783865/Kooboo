1. This parser does not execute javascript or take into the consideration of javascript write. 

for example, In the following example, the tree construction stage will be called upon to 
handle a "p" start tag token while handling the "script" end tag token:

...
<script>
 document.write('<p>');
</script>
...

This is ignored for now.

2. We do not check encoding for now.

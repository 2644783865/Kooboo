Please be aware of the following remarks. 

1. all selctorText are treated as case-insensitive right now. which means. 
.someClass is identical to .Someclass, and will be groupby or merge in the cssRules (ruleList).
This is generally true, but not 100% true because HTML document type might define class name to be case-sensitive.
